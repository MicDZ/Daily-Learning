#  China, U.S. conclude high-level strategic dialogue in 'candid, constructive' manner
https://newsus.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-20/Meeting-between-senior-Chinese-and-U-S-officials-wraps-up-YLPmj64DXW/index.html
The first face-to-face meeting between senior Chinese and U.S. officials from the Biden administration has wrapped up in Alaska.
The two-day dialogue marked the first high-level contact between the two countries after their heads of state had a phone call on the eve of the Chinese lunar new year.
In a press conference afterward, senior Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi said the China-U.S. talks were candid, constructive and beneficial. "But, of course, there are still differences between the two sides."
"We came to the meeting with the hope that the two sides could enhance communication and dialogue on different fronts. The two sides should follow the policy of 'no conflict' to guide our path towards a healthy and stable trajectory moving forward."
China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the Chinese delegation went to Alaska with strong sincerity. Dialogue is better than confrontation, he said, adding that China made it clear to the Americans that sovereignty is a matter of principle and they should not underestimate China's determination to defend it.
According to the statement released by the Chinese delegation, China pointed out that it has no intention of interfering in America's political system or to challenge and replace the U.S. position and its influence. It called on the U.S. side to properly view China's political system, its development path, national strategies as well as its influence worldwide.
China reiterated that there would be no compromise on the Taiwan question, calling it a core interest of China and a matter of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The officials urged the U.S. side to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and to stop official exchanges and military contacts with Taiwan in any form.
Regarding the recent decisions made by China's top legislature, the National People's Congress, on the improvement of the electoral system in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the officials said the U.S. should respect the decision and follow international law and basic norms of international relations.
The Chinese delegation also urged the U.S. side to rescind illegal sanctions against Chinese officials and institutions, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and other China's internal affairs, and stop hindering China's efforts in implementing the principle of "One Country, Two Systems."
'Xinjiang genocide' claim: 'Biggest lie of the century'
According to China, the claim that there is genocide in China's Xinjiang is the biggest lie of the century.
The delegation said the door of Xinjiang is wide open to the world, and the Chinese side is ready to engage in exchanges with the U.S. side on the basis of mutual respect.
But meanwhile, China will not accept any investigation in Xinjiang based on the presumption of guilt by those who are biased and condescending, and who want to lecture China, the delegation stressed.
It is hoped that the U.S. side can respect facts, call off attacks against and smearing of China's Xinjiang policy, and abandon double standards on anti-terrorism, it added.
As the U.S. delegation exited the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken told reporters that the U.S. delegation knew there are a number of areas where China and the U.S. would be at odds, but the two parties were also able to have a very candid discussion on areas where their interests meet.
Blinken said the two worked on an expansive agenda on Iran, Afghanistan, DPRK, and climate change. "We wanted to lay out our policies, priorities, and world view and we did that," Blinken said.

#  Chinese diplomat urges U.S., UK to address problems of racism, xenophobia violence
https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-20/China-urges-U-S-UK-to-address-issues-of-racism-xenophobia-violence-YM6KPvTcD6/index.html
A senior Chinese diplomat on Friday urged the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the "relevant" European Union countries to "address serious problems of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobic violence at home." 
Chen Xu, China's permanent representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG), made the statement at the ongoing 46th Session of the UN Human Rights Council. 
"This year marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Program of Action (DDPA). We support the African Group's view on mobilizing political will on the full and effective implementation of the DDPA," he said. 
The COVID-19 pandemic, he said, has exacerbated the existing structural inequalities and systemic racism and racial discrimination, and requires a global response. 
The U.S. has said at this UN meeting that it would face up to its own problems of racism and racial discrimination. "We hope that the United States could turn its public statements into concrete actions," said the Chinese diplomat.

The U.S. should address, among other things, racism, racial discrimination and police brutality, prohibit the spread of racist speech, crack down on discrimination and hate-driven violence against African and Asian Americans, and Muslims, protect the rights of ethnic minorities, commit itself to the international campaign against racism, and facilitate the implementation of the DDPA, Chen said. 
"We urge the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the relevant EU countries to take steps likewise to address serious problems of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobic violence at home," he said. 
China has always been firmly opposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, hate speech and related intolerance, said the Chinese diplomat. 
China also agrees with the recommendations of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet that call for "addressing the root causes of racism and inequality," Chen said.

#  China unveils new discoveries from Sanxingdui, over 500 items unearthed
https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-20/China-unveils-new-discoveries-from-Sanxingdui-YMkx9az0Yg/index.html
Chinese archaeologists announced on Saturday that some new major discoveries have been made at the legendary Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China, helping shed light on the cultural origins of the Chinese nation. 
Archaeologists have found six new sacrificial pits and unearthed more than 500 items dating back about 3,000 years at the Sanxingdui Ruins in Sichuan Province, the National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA) announced in the provincial capital Chengdu.

Over 500 precious cultural relics discovered
Ranging from 3.5 to 19 square meters, these six sacrificial pits, which were discovered from November 2019 to May 2020, are in rectangular shape, according to NCHA. Among them, pits No.3, No.4, No.5 and No.6 have been excavated to the utensil layer so far, while pits No.7 and No.8 are being backfilled.

Together they form an area in which people of the ancient Shu civilization offered sacrifices to heaven, Earth and their ancestors, and prayed for prosperity and peace, according to Tang Fei, head of the excavation team at Sanxingdui and chief of the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute.
The discoveries have shown the distinctiveness of the Shu civilization and the diversity of the Chinese civilization, said Ran Honglin, another researcher with the institute.

During the process, archaeologists have made full use of modern scientific and technological means to build an archaeological excavation cabin, integrated excavation platform and multi-functional excavation operation system. 
With the support of professional teams of multiple disciplines and institutions, they have formed an integrated work mode combining traditional archaeology, laboratory archaeology, technological archaeology as well as the protection of cultural relics. The combination will ensure the high quality and high level of archaeological work, NCHA said at the conference.

Meanwhile, the NCHA has identified the "Research on the Civilization Process of Bashu in Sichuan-Chongqing Region" as a major program of the "Archaeological China" project, aiming to conduct in-depth study on the evolution of civilization in the region and its integration into the overall cultural landscape of the pluralistic unity of the Chinese nation.

Located in the city of Guanghan, some 40 kilometers from Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu, the Sanxingdui Ruins site is regarded one of the most important archaeological discoveries in the 20th century. The excavation has lasted for nearly 100 years since the first discovery in the late 1920s.
In 1986, archaeologists found two large-scale sacrificial pits dating back to the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BC). Thousands of rare treasures were discovered from the two pits.
