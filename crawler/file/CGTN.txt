<h1 class="print"> China's factory activity growth edges down in July on maintenance and weather factors </h1>
<hr>
<a class="no-print" href=" https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-07-31/China-s-manufacturing-activities-maintain-expansion-in-July-12kZKHsUUw0/index.html "> 原文链接 </a> 


<p>China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a key gauge of manufacturing activities, edged down to 50.4 in July due to equipment maintenance period, and extreme weather impacts in some areas, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Saturday.</p> 

<p>A reading above 50 indicates expansion in activities, while a reading below reflects contraction. The manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50 mark for 17 straight months.</p> 

<p>"Some companies have entered the equipment maintenance period, coupled with the impact of extreme weather such as high temperature and floods in some areas, the expansion of the manufacturing industry has weakened compared with the previous month," said Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician with the NBS.</p> 

<p>Manufacturing production activities and market demand have generally slowed in July. The new orders subindex dropped to 50.9 in July, compared with 51.5 in June. The subindex for new export orders fell to 47.7 in July versus 48.1 in June.</p> 

<p>The production and demand have decreased notably in high energy-consuming industries such as petroleum, coal and other fuel processing, chemical raw materials and chemical products.</p> 

<p>By firm size, the PMI for large enterprises surveyed was 51.7 percent, flat with last month, while small and medium-sized enterprises inched down to 47.8 percent and 50.0 percent, narrowing down by 1.3 and 0.8 percentage points from last month, respectively.</p> 

<p>Some small and medium-sized enterprises surveyed reported that their production and operation are under pressure because of the costs increase in raw material, the reduction in orders, and the increased pressure on payment, said Zhao.</p> 

<p><strong>Non-manufacturing PMI </strong></p> 

<p>China's official non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction activities, edged down to 53.3 in July from 53.5 in June.</p> 

<p>The PMI for service industry has increased, driven by summer vacation consumption and other factors. The business activity index of the service industry rose by 0.2 percentage points from the previous month to 52.5 percent, showing the recovery trend of the industry, said Zhao.</p> 

<p>The PMI for construction industry, however, fell by 2.6 percentage points from the previous month to 57.5 percent, dragged by high temperature and rain, floods and other unfavorable weather factors.</p>
